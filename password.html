    <p><strong>Dear Participant,</strong></p>
    <p>We want to express our sincere gratitude for your participation in our recent research experiment.
        <br>Your involvement has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of decision-making processes in uncertain conditions.</p>

    <p>In this experiment, you were presented with a series of decision tasks involving the selection of blue or red pitchers, each containing varying proportions of colored balls.
        <br>Your decisions were made in a group setting, and the final choices were determined by majority votes.</p>

    <p> <strong>Purpose of the Experiment and Research Hypothesis:</strong>

    The primary goal of this study was to investigate the strategic behavior of rational agents under conditions of uncertainty.
        <br>We aimed to understand how individuals make decisions when they have partial information and must rely on group majority to determine the outcome.
        <br>Specifically, we sought to examine how participants assess signal strength, group size, and the majority vote mechanism to choose between blue and red pitchers.</p>

    <p><strong> Strategic Behaviour of Rational Agents:</strong>

    In the experiment, you were asked to make choices that involved financial incentives, and your decisions were made strategically based on the available information.
        <br>This concept of strategic behavior by rational agents underlines the importance of making choices that maximize potential gains and minimize potential losses.</p>

    <p>In situations characterized by uncertainty, individuals often employ strategies that take into account not only their private information but also the behavior of others.
        <br>This strategic interaction can lead to diverse decision patterns and outcomes, which we aimed to explore in this experiment.</p>

    <p>Your valuable participation has contributed significantly to our research, and your decisions have helped shed light on the fascinating dynamics of decision-making in group settings.
        <br>We appreciate your time and effort in taking part in this experiment.</p>
